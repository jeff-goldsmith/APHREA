This short course will use tools in R and RStudio, as well as some additional packages. 

Although there are no formal prerequisites for this short course, coming prepared with a laptop that has relevant software will facilitate a smooth experience.

It is recommended that participants install the most recent versions of [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) before the short course begins. 

Next, open RStudio and install several packages (and their dependencies) using the code below:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  c("tidyverse", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "janitor", "broom", "here", "readxl", 
    "haven", "rnoaa", "viridis"))
```
