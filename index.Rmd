title: "APHREA-DST Short Course"
---

This short course was originally developed as part of the Launching Workshop of [APHREA-DST](https://www.fic.nih.gov/Grants/Search/Pages/dsi-u2rtw012123.aspx). It has been updated and expanded to include additional training and resources. 

Public health data science (PHDS) depends on the mastery of tools for computation, exploratory analysis, visualization, dissemination, and reproducibility, in addition to proficiency in traditional statistical techniques. The goal of this short course is to provide an introduction to some elements of a  pipeline for data analysis. We will develop skills in project organization, reproducible research, data wrangling, and visualization; all programming will be done in R. Although there are no formal prerequisites for this short course, some familiarity with statistics and basic programming knowledge will be helpful.
